# Genie Tutor

This Python project, developed for the TreeHacks 2023 hackathon at Stanford, leverages the GPT API to create an innovative application aimed at assisting international students in navigating their high school experience. The application seamlessly integrates natural language processing to provide valuable information and support to students.

## Key Functionalities:

### Interactive Questioning

Utilizes the GPT API for generating questions based on user input in natural language.
Prompts users to input questions related to their high school experience.

### Chapter Reference Retrieval

Extracts relevant information by querying the GPT API for the chapters in JEE, AP, and IB that can explain the generated questions.
Enhances user understanding of the academic material covered in different curricula.

### Similar Question Generation

Utilizes GPT API to generate similar questions from JEE targeting the same concept as the user's input.
Provides additional practice and reinforces understanding.

### Multilingual Support

Facilitates translation of the generated English response into the user's mother language.
Promotes inclusivity and accessibility for international students.
